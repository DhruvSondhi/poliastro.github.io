Contributing to Poliastro has been an incredible experience for me. Since it was the first time, I've participated in GSOC. And the first time I've ever approached to package dedicated to problems arising in Astrodynamics and Orbital Mechanics. Being part of Poliastro was an exciting challenge that I had to surmount and also an unbelievable opportunity to learn about Space, Math and Physics.

With the thorough knowledge learned, and the feedback from JuanLu and Jorge, I was able to overcome every challenge in my Poliastro's journey. As I had said when I had the opportunity, I am grateful to both of my mentors who accepted me to be part of this exceptional community.  :)

# Git-log

What we have achieved in the past three months:

- [#965 Stationary and Synchronous Orbit Implementation](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A%40me+is%3Aclosed)
- [# 969 Fix for the flaky Horizon Test](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/969)
- [#970 Earth Satellite Implementation](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A%40me+is%3Aclosed)
- [#979 Spacecraft Implementation](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/979)
- [#987 Pericenter maneuver implementation](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/987)
- [#998 Field of View Implementation](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/998)

Open PRs:

- [#984 Repeat Ground Track Orbit Implementation](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/984)
- [#1002 Daily repeat groundtrack Mars orbit](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/1002)

# Ongoing challenge

And we will be continuing working together on the [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334130047_Coverage_Area_Determination_for_Conical_Fields_of_View_Considering_an_Oblate_Earth), named " Coverage Area Determination for Conical Fields of View Considering an Oblate Earth." Sounds great, right? The paper is from Politecnico di Milano, the Italian university where JuanLu studied while coding Poliastro :D . So, there are exciting things ahead!

This is all for now. In case I donâ€™t see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night! :) ðŸš€
